# rock_paper_scissors_java

When the program of the line or Main method is run), an odd number> = 3 non-repeating lines is passed (if the arguments are incorrectly specified, print a neat error message - what is wrong, an example is how it is correct). These lines are moves (for example, Rock Paper Scissors or Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9).
Victory is defined as follows - the sequence of the next wins in the circle, half of the previous ones in the circle lose (the semantics of the lines is not important, in which the user enters, and plays in that).
